# Scalar CAS Authentication 

A plugin for [anvc/scalar](https://github.com/anvc/scalar).

This plugin allows users to authenticate using CAS in addition to the existing email/password authentication.

**NOTE**: Currently a work in progress and will require some minor modifications to Scalar core. This will be updated when it is ready for production use.
