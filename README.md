# Scalar CAS Authentication 

A plugin for [anvc/scalar](https://github.com/anvc/scalar). This plugin allows users to authenticate using CAS in addition to the existing email/password authentication.

_Currently a work in progress and will require some minor modifications to Scalar core. This will be updated when it is ready for production use._

## Quickstart

1. Download and unzip to `system/applications/plugins/CasAuth`
2. Update `system/applications/config/local_settings.php` to use this plugin.
